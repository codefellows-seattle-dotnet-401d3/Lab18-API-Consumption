# Consume the API

**Author**: Arthur Allen

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Exercise in consuming a thrid party API and integrating it into my own API using the usual API verbs.  I'm planning on using the GoComics.com API because their comment system has been lacking and I have been wanting to improve it for years.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Visual Studio 2017, .Net Core, Postman

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Added functionality to add and delete some things. -->
04-12-2018 10:55am - Project started.
04-15-2018 8:45pm - Project stalled.  I couldn't figure out the API for GoComics.com, and I couldn't deploy the To Do list to Azure.  If I can't deploy that to Azure, I can't deploy this project or its own databases to Azure.  I was able to follow along the class YouTube tutorial again to get as far on this program as I did.
